# DES
Discrete Event Simulator | Summer '19 Internship

This program simulates telemetry data for a number of industrial tanks. It was coupled with an IoT pipeline that 
I helped produce to facilitate data to an open source database (i.e. PostgreSQL). From there, I used an ML program
that could detect anomalistic behavior with around an 86% accuracy. This collective project from the summer lowered the cost of
vertical farming use cases and improved total cost of ownership.
